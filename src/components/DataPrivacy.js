                  AI can be used to develop predictive models to aid in the
                  diagnosis of medical conditions. However, medical data is
                  highly sensitive, and its privacy must be maintained. An
                  AI-based consultancy can help healthcare organizations ensure
                  that their predictive models are both accurate and compliant
                  with data privacy regulations.
